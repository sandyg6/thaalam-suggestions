# thaalam-suggestions
## Description
The Thalam Suggestion program is a Python hardcoded software designed to suggest a suitable thalam (rhythm cycle) for a given Tamil sentence, typically lyrics of a song. The program follows specific rules of Tamil ilakkanam (grammar) to tokenize the text into words and letters, then calculates the maathirai count (syllable count) of the sentence. Based on this maathirai count, the program suggests a thalam that best fits the rhythm of the sentence.
